# Concept and Use Cases

[Mullvad wrote up a paper](%20https://mullvad.net/media/system-transparency-rev5.pdf) on what they call System Transparency. System transparency is aimed at facilitating trust for the components of a system by giving every server a unique identity, limiting the attack surface and mutable state in the firmware and allowing both owners and users to verify all software running on a platform starting from the first instruction executed after power on. System Transparency accomplishes these goals by the seven principles listed in the manifest.
