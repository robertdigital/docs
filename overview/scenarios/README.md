description: How to use System Transparency in the real world?

# Scenarios

We defined three real world scenarios which should at least support a high chance that we have covered a lot hardware systems. We categorized the scenarios based on the firmware with levels. With the lowest firmware level it is possible make the whole system stack transparent.

### FL3: Mixed firmware

Your hardware runs closed source firmware in legacy CSM mode or the firmware itself is a BIOS. Most systems nowadays already runs UEFI firmware. Please check if the CSM mode in your BIOS settings is enabled if you want to use this scenario.

Execution flow: MBR is executed

Bootloaders: Syslinux, ST provides harddrive image

Requirements: CSM mode or BIOS

### FL2: UEFI firmware

Your hardware runs closed source UEFI firmware with the CSM mode disabled in the firmware settings. **This mode is currently not support by System Transparency**. Feel free to do a pull request and help us out!

Execution flow: GPT, efi partition, UEFI application

Bootloaders: None, stboot can be packed with Linux kernel as EFI application

Requirements: Secure Boot user mode or OEM keys support stboot

### FL1: Open Source firmware

Your hardware runs open source firmware. This can be [coreboot](www.coreboot.org), [TianoCore](www.tianocore.org), [slimmbootloader](https://slimbootloader.github.io/) or [u-boot](http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot). System Transparency has specific firmware requirements. As far we know only coreboot is able to satisfy these requirements. That is why we only support coreboot firmware at the moment.

Execution flow: Payload is executed in firmware

Bootloaders: None, stboot and Linux kernel are part of coreboot payload

Requirements: coreboot capable hardware with 16MB BIOS flash
