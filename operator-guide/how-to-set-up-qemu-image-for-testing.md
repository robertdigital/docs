# How to set up qemu image for testing

## Prerequisites

* Linux system \(tested with Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS \(Bionic Beaver\) / Kernel 4.15.0-47-generic
* GCC 8.3.0
* Golang v 1.12 \(see [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)
  * make sure to also create a workspace at `$HOME/go` \(see [test Go](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing)\)
  * make sure `$HOME/go/bin` and `/usr/local/go/bin` or '/usr/bin/go are added to `PATH` environment variable
* clone of u-root and system-transparency repository
* u-root must be installed
* QEMU emulator \(tested with version 2.11.1\)
* Provisioning server with https-request capability
* ssh access to [root@yourserver.test](mailto:root@yourserver.test) \(your 'provisioning server'\)

## Idea

This tutorial is just for the sake of testing the boot process of your BootBall. QEMU is utilized to simulate your production server. A SysLinux image with u-root initramfs and stboot bootloader is loaded inside QEMU. The QEMU starts the SysLinux and initiate the boot process with STBoot. STBoot will download the BootBall deployed on your provisioning server. Here it will be shown how to build the SysLinux image and u-root initramfs with stboot bootloader. 

### Step by step

#### 1.

At first we want to build the SysLinux image. For that, system-transparency provides a script:

```text
./system-transparency/deploy/image/create_image.sh
```

#### 2.

Second step is to build the initramfs with u-root. Make sure u-root is installed, otherwise run:

```text
./system-transparency/stboot/install-u-root.sh
```

#### 3.

Now u-root with stboot support should be installed. Create the initramfs for the QEMU image with:

```text
./system-transparency/stboot/make_initramfs.sh
```

#### 4.

Your "production server" or in this case you QEMU image needs an IP configuration. For this purpose we generate a file called hostvars.json. We do so by using a script:

```text
./system-transparency/stboot/create_hostvars.sh
```

This file needs to me moved in the SysLinux image as well. And system-transparency provide a script for that as well:

```text
./system-transparency/deploy/image/mv_hostvars_to_image.sh
```

#### 5.

Before executing QEMU we need to merge the initramfs into the SysLinux image. Worry not, system-transparency repository provides a script for that as well:

```text
./system-transparecy/deploy/image/mv_initrd_to_image.sh
```

#### 6.

Okay, now it is time to run the image in QEMU. Maybe u guessed it, we also have a script for that:

```text
./system-transparency/start_qemu_image.sh
```

If everything works correctly, QEMU starts up, loads the image and you'll see some ASCII art STBoot logo.  
At this point, you can press CTRL+C and interrupt the boot process of STBoot. This will drop you into the shell of the SysLinux / u-root initramfs.
