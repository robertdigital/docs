# Get System Transparency up and running

![](../.gitbook/assets/stcomponents.svg)

To get _System Transparency_ running on your hosts you need to set up a provisioning server. Your machine should run Linux in order to use all the tooling required.

On Debian-based systems you'll need the following packages:

```text
apt install golang docker.io openssl git qemu-system-x86 wget sudo bison flex pkg-config libelf-dev libssl-dev bc libc6-i386 gcc-8 g++-8
```

The tooling is hosted at [https://github.com/system-transparency/system-transparency](https://github.com/system-transparency/system-transparency). The following pages will guide you through the process of setting up _System Transparency_.
